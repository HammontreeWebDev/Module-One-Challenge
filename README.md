# Module One Challenge
## Challenge Goal
**User Story:**\
AS A marketing agency\
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards\
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines\
<br>
**Acceptance Criteria:**\
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards\
WHEN I view the source code\
THEN I find semantic HTML elements\
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements\
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning\
WHEN I view the image elements\
THEN I find accessible alt attributes\
WHEN I view the heading attributes\
THEN they fall in sequential order\
WHEN I view the title element\
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title\
## Description
For this challenge, I edited a starter code to comply with new HTML standards.\
This included replacing several div and class tags with semantic HTML such as header, \
footer, and section elements. I also was responsible for making sure that the code appeared \
to be in a logical format. Alt attributes were added to the images.\
 I added comments to everything that I edited.\
 <br>
 The original functionality and integrity of the website was preserved.
